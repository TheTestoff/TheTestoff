### _"The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel." - Neuromancer_ 

#### While waiting to be a neuromancer, here is my Github!

My name is Julien, and I am a Biomedical Engineering graduate from University College London.
But most importantly, I am a neurotechnology enthusiast, currently interning in computational neuroscience at Radboud University.
On this Github, you will find my repositories. I mainly work private ones, but an occasional public ones might pop-up once or twice.
I intend for all my projects to be found on this page, and currently work in progress, my own CV website.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on sleep & memory research. As I am a student, I am constantly on the lookout for any offer to intern in both academic & private neurotech jobs involving data science, software development or biomedical enginering.

- ðŸ’¬ About me: I am based in Netherlands, but studied in the UK. I easily move around so this statement will probably be False in 2 months.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can easily reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julien-guerville-a2195b197/), or through my [email](julien.guerville@hotmail.com)
